    In the actual user test, the three options above were randomized, so the final option woudln't succeed simply because people get better at the <strong>concept</strong> of segmenting users.
    <br />
    <br />
    There are a lot of rough edges inside the prototypes, but the path to completion of persona segments was a complete one.  Any of the persona segments could have been completed with any of the prototypes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Link</strong> is a recreation of segment editor we were currently using, which was designed about 2 years prior.  This one performed OK as long as it was not first in the test: people could understand it if they had experience building segments, but it was intemidating if it was their first exposure to the concept.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Link</strong> is the "buried details" version.  Users could potentially make a decent segment without ever dipping down into details, and they could easily read the results at a later time.  This was the overall winner, and it served as the foundation of what we implemented.</li>
      <li><strong>Third Link</strong> is the "wizard" prototype, where people could modify most of the details of a question with the mouse in a flyout helper.  This did astonishingly poorly.</li>
